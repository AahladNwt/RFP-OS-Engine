    - Risk Assessment: For each identified risk, provide a 'Likelihood' rating. Support your assessment with data points or analogous project experiences if possible.
    - Mitigation Strategies: Discuss immediate, short-term, and long-term steps. Be specific about the tools, techniques, or best practices that will be employed.
    - Stakeholder Communication: Detail how key stakeholders will be informed and engaged throughout the process.
    - Adaptive Measures: Outline alternative strategies ('Plan B' options) should primary mitigation steps prove ineffective.
