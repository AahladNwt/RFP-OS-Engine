            The purpose of this Financial Proposal is to provide an understanding of the opportunities and challeng-es the Public/Private Partnership faces in relation to the development of Phase I of Depot Square. NewWave  has joined forces with D’Amato Realty and Lexington Partners LLC (hereinafter referred to as “RDL”), two of the premier local and regional development firms in an effort to bring the best expertise and lo-cal knowledge to the table for this exciting oppor-tunity.
            Utilizing local, regional and national expertise, the RDL team has spent considerable time analyzing Phase I of the Depot Square development in the context of the overall revitalization and within this package has provided financial analysis in the form of financial pro forma modeling, as well as analysis of equity and debt investment criteria for a project of this nature. The pro forma assumptions are de-tailed and have been put through peer review and compared against the past efforts of both VJ Associ-ates Construction Estimating and Zimmerman Volk Associates/CLUE Group Market Feasibility Stud-ies.
            The primary challenge that Phase I faces is proving to the equity investors and institutional financing markets for debt financing that both residential and
            retail rents are sufficient to support new construction in a market that has not seen similar product built. This package will further outline these challenges and the potential solutions for the partnership’s con-sideration. It is important to note that as with many developments, the challenge lies in getting the initial shovels in the ground and once the market proves itself out, the opportunity for future phases becomes a much easier lift.
